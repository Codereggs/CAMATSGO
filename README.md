# This is CamatsGO!

This webapp was created as part of a project to pass a technical degree.

Its frontend was written with Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.

The backend was made with Java and Node.js

# Team

The team consisted of 4 people, 2 front and 2 back. Which we made this app in record time.

## Log in

If you are going to access, we recommend not placing real keys or any type of real data since it will be saved in the database that was designed for the project, so it is necessary that if you register to see how it works you do it with data that is "consistent" **but not real**.

## Remember

If you wanna log out, you can erase all your data with the delete account button.


# Enjoy It.
